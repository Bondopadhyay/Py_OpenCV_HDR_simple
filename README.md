# Py_OpenCV_HDR_simple
Make your ordinary images better with OpenCV's tweaking.
Higher HDR or High Dynamic Range makes light intensity more in-depth. The more the difference is between the lightest and the darkest tone of images, the more prominent it looks. The biggest con is that the images do not always look naturally soothing. Cheap photographers' works and movie producers and seldom, substandard movie producers create higher-HDR tones. However, the models from generative AIs' platforms such as DALL-E, Midjourney, etc have a great understanding of the light intensity's play in any scenario and every day, it's evolving.
