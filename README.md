# Py_OpenCV_HDR_simple
Make your oridnary images better with OpenCV's tweaking.
Higher HDR or High Dynamic Range makes light intensity more in-depth. More the difference is there between tghe lightest and the darkest tone of images, more prominent it does look like. The biggest con is that the images do not always look naturally soothing. Cheap photogeapher's works and movie producers and seldom, substandard movie prodcucer create higher-HDR tones. However, the models from generative AIs' platforms such as DALL-E, Midjourney etc have a great understanding of the light intensity's play in any scenario and everyday, it's evolving.
